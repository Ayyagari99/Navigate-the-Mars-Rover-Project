# The Mars Rover Project
The aim of this project is to help the Mars Curiosity Rover find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles on the way. To complete its objectives of finding more data about chemical composition, life, etc. on Mars, the rover may need to move from one place to another, as quickly as possible, while avoiding the different obstacles present on mars like- hills, craters, storms etc. This project aims to help the rover achieve that.
